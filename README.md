# RT in one weekend

This is an implementation of the book and online-post "Raytracing in one weekend".

If you'd like to do this yourself, check it out [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
For an overview of all other available resources, visit their [io page](https://raytracing.github.io/)!

# Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fr4cK5/raytracing-in-one-weekend-rs ./rtiow
cd ./rtiow
cargo run -r
```

After running the program, you'll find a file `test-img.pmm` in the project's root directory.
To look at it either use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or some online PPM-Viewer tool.
